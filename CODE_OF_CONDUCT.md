# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all. We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language. With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:

*   Respecting the purpose of our community, our activities, and our ways of gathering.
*   Engaging kindly and honestly with others.
*   Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
*   Taking responsibility for our actions and contributions.
*   Gracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback.
*   Committing to repairing harm when it occurs.
*   Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the well-being of our community.

## Restricted Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct.

*   **Harassment.** Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
*   **Character attacks.** Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
*   **Stereotyping or discrimination.** Characterizing anyone's personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
*   **Sexualization.** Using sexualized language or imagery, or engaging in unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   **Violating confidentiality.** Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
*   **Endangerment.** Threatening or inciting violence, or promoting self-harm.
*   Behaving in other ways that threaten the well-being of our community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public or other spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at <mailto:max.azatian@gmail.com>. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
